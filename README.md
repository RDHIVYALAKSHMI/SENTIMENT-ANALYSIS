## DESCRIPTION OF TASK 

The task involves performing sentiment analysis on textual data, such as tweets or reviews, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to determine the sentiment conveyed in the text, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. This process involves several key steps. First, data preprocessing is conducted to clean the text by removing noise, such as URLs, special characters, and stopwords, as well as normalizing the text through techniques like lowercasing and stemming. 

This prepares the data for effective feature extraction. Next, the text is transformed into numerical representations using methods such as TF-IDF Vectorization or word embeddings, enabling machine learning algorithms to interpret the data. A suitable model, like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models such as LSTM or BERT, is then implemented to classify the sentiment. After training the model on a labeled dataset, its performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. 

Insights are drawn by analyzing these metrics, along with visualizations such as accuracy plots, confusion matrices, and class distribution graphs. The deliverable for this task is a well-documented notebook showcasing the complete workflow, including data preprocessing steps, model implementation, evaluation metrics, and visual insights. This comprehensive approach helps understand the sentiment patterns within the textual data and can be applied to various domains, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and brand reputation management.
